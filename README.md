# ATM-Program
Simulates an ATM. 


This program simulates an ATM machine where auser can input their pin and withdraw, deposit, and observe current balance with an exit feature as well. This was 
written in C++ and was a fun little project.

I was interested on how banking systems operate and decided to try create my own banking application. Although it is not an extravagant application, 
it is an accomplishment of mine I am happy about.
